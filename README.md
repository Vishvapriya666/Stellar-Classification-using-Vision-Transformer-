# Stellar-Classification-using-Vision-Transformer-
This is my final year project for the academic year 2023-2024. This was the most challenging project in my academic years. Please take a look at the readme file for the details of the project.

Problem statement: To develop a deep learning classification system with the help of a Vision Transformer to classify and analyze interstellar bodies with accuracy and efficiency. 

# About Vision Transformer-
Vision Transformer (ViT) is a deep learning architecture that revolutionizes computer vision tasks by applying transformer models, originally designed for natural language processing, to image data. Unlike traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), ViT processes images as sequences of fixed-size patches, treating each patch as a token. These patches are linearly embedded and fed into a transformer encoder, allowing the model to capture long-range dependencies in images. ViT's self-attention mechanism enables it to focus on relevant image regions, enhancing its ability to understand complex visual patterns. ViT has demonstrated remarkable performance on various vision tasks, making it a promising approach for image recognition, object detection, and other computer vision applications.

# Stellar Classification-
Stellar classification is the systematic categorization of stars based on their observable characteristics, primarily their spectral features and luminosity. 
In this project,we try to classify different types of interstellar objects in the outer space. 

Steps involved in the development of the project are written in the following 
- Data collection and proprocessing
- Data Visualisation
- Class definition
- Feature Selection  
- Model Training
- Model Testing
- Prediction

#Data Collection and Preprocessing 
We worked on two types of datasets, that is text dataset and image dataset. We obtained the text data from SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey) 17th release. 
We analysed the text data to understand the spectral behaviour of the star and other interstellar objects. 
And the image dataset was collected from the images obtained from JWST (James Webb Space Telescope) and HST (Hubble Space Telescope). The images was consolidated and resized to 512*512 for the image processing task using VIT.

# Class definition 
We have considered three classes for the classification; Galaxy, Quasar and Star
Galaxy- A galaxy is a vast system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter bound together by gravity. Galaxies come in various shapes and sizes, ranging from spiral and elliptical to irregular. They are the building blocks of the universe, containing billions to trillions of stars and numerous planetary systems.

Quasar- Also known as AGN (Active galactic nucleus) quasar, short for "quasi-stellar radio source," is an extremely luminous and energetic celestial object at the center of a galaxy. It emits intense radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum, powered by a supermassive black hole consuming surrounding matter. Quasars serve as powerful probes for studying the early universe due to their extreme brightness and distant locations.

Star-A star is a celestial object primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, undergoing nuclear fusion in its core, emitting light and heat. Stars are the fundamental building blocks of galaxies, including our own Milky Way. They vary in size, temperature, and luminosity, and their life cycles influence the universe's evolution and dynamics.

# Data Visualisation
For the text dataset, we analysed and dataset and plotted graphs which are given in the following.
